      <p>
        My name's Andrea.
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm a junior programmer and ex marketing and advertising professional by trade. I make fun things like this website and the occasional app or machine learning program.
        <br>
        <br>
        In my spare time you'll find me watching AFL, going to the beach, playing mixed netball, going to live music gigs or discovering a new craft sour.
        <br>
        <br>
        Whether I'm on the clock or out and about I love discovering patterns, understanding how people think and making the world a safer and more fair place for everyone to live.
        <br>

    <!-- The Journey-->
    <section class="journey">
      <h1>The Journey</h1>
      <h2>Born</h2>
      <p>I've been curious about the world for as long as I can remember. My first word was "more" ... read into that what you will. </p>

      <h2>Inspired by Gruen Transfer</h2>
      <p>As a teenager I was obsessed with the ABC tv show Gruen. I loved how ads could make you feel something with so few words, or so little time. </p>
      <p>I took this passion and completed a Commerce Degree at UWA majoring in Marketing, Economics and Business Law.</p>

      <h2>Got a big girl job</h2>
      <p>I was lucky enough to snag an internship, and later a full time job, at one of the big ad agencies in Perth - Meerkats (now called Wunderman Thompson).</p>
      <p>I learnt heaps there about project management, the creative industry and most importantly the art of diplomacy.</p>

      <h2>Ballet came pirouette-ing into my life</h2>
      <p>I took a quick 3 month contract at West Australian Ballet in the Marketing Team.</p>
      <p>Although I kind of fell in love with it and was there for the next 5 years.</p>

      <h2>"More" came back into my life</h2>
      <p>Around the time COVID-19 hit I started feeling a bit restless at work.</p>
      <p>I got excited by the potential and challenge of learning something new. So I looked into Programming.</p>

      <h2>f"{code} hey?";</h2>
      <p>I completed a Cert IV in Programming and made some fun stuff - including writing this site.</p>

      <h2>Work in progress</h2>
      <p>My career has been a little unusual I guess but it's just a start. Hopefully there's way more to come!</p>
