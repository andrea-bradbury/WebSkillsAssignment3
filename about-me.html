      <h1>Hey, nice to meet you</h1>
      <p>
        I was drawn to the creativity of advertising but soon made my way to ballet, now I use the creativity of advertising, the drive for excellence of ballet and the art of code to make beautifully functional solutions to problems.

    <!-- The Journey-->
    <section class="journey">
      <h1>The Journey</h1>
      <h2>Born</h2>
      <p>I've been curious about the world for as long as I can remember. My first word was "more" ... read into that what you will. </p>

      <h2>Inspired by Gruen Transfer</h2>
      <p>As a teenager I was obsessed with Gruen and advertising. I loved how ads could make you feel something with so few words, or so little time. </p>
      <p>I took this passion and completed a Commerce Degree at UWA.</p>

      <h2>Got a big girl job</h2>
      <p>I was lucky enough to snag an internship and later a full time job at one of the big ad agencies in Perth - Meerkats (now called Wunderman Thompson).</p>
      <p>I learnt heaps there about project management, the creative industry and most importantly the art of diplomacy.</p>

      <h2>Ballet came pirouette-ing into my life</h2>
      <p>I took a quick 3 month contract at West Australian Ballet in the Marketing Team.</p>
      <p>Although I kind of fell in love with it and was there for the next 5 years.</p>

      <h2>"More" came back into my life</h2>
      <p>Around the time COVID-19 hit I started feeling a bit restless.</p>
      <p>I got excited by the potential and challenge of learning something new. So I looked into Programming.</p>

      <h2>Code hey...</h2>
      <p>I completed a Cert IV in Programming. I made some fun stuff with computer languages - including writing this site.</p>

      <h2>Work in progress</h2>
      <p>My career has been a little unusual I guess but it's just a start and hopefully there's way more to come!</p>
